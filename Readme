Introduction

This repository contains information referencing from Jupyter Notebooks, Datasets and Source Materials used as part of the project. In this project, Machine Learning are used for risk assessment in the prediction for bankruptcy of companies. Following which, the mentioned prediction can be obtained using suitable models, through various Machine Learning techniques. The purpose of this ReadMe file highlights the key summary accomplished in this project. Of note, readers can refer to the Jupyter Notebook, where the contents residing within the project offers in-depth descriptions, which are not mentioned here.

1.  Introduction

This is a project for Nanyang Technological Unviersity Singapore on SC1015 module (i.e. Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). In this project, we chose to explore various machine learning models to predict the sucess of a company.

2.  Problem Formulation

What are the key variables that determine the success of the company, and are we able to detect companies that are in the midst of bankruptcy through the result of various NLP modelling techniques?

3.  Data Preparation / Cleaning

Dataset Source: Company Bankruptcy Prediction from Kaggle
